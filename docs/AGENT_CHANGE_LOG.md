# AGENT CHANGE LOG

This file is the source of truth for all agent-initiated changes. Every time an agent makes modifications, it MUST append an entry here. This log is committed to git so memory survives across sessions/agents.

### [2026-10-24 23:48:56] - [Agent: Cline] - [COMMITTED]
- Task: Make the build deterministic (stop pre-existing generated-file churn at source)
- Files changed:
  - scripts/build_link_registry.mjs (sorted Map iteration; content-derived epoch replacing `Date.now()`)
  - scripts/build_restaurant_directory.py (content-derived `buildStamp` replacing `time.time()`; `time` import dropped, `hashlib` added)
  - scripts/seeds/business_links.sql (regenerated)
  - assets/data/restaurant_listings/eatouts_manifest.js (regenerated)
  - assets/data/link_registry.json (regenerated - key order follows the now-sorted candidates; key set unchanged)
  - docs/AGENT_CHANGE_LOG.md (this entry, amended into the same commit)
- Commit: A-FIX.5
- Push: pending
- Notes:
  Three independent non-determinism sources were removed:
    1. `scripts/build_link_registry.mjs` iterated a `Map` without sorting -> candidates/rows followed
       insertion order. Now sorted by brand key (defence-in-depth).
    2. `scripts/build_link_registry.mjs` stamped EVERY row's `created_at`/`updated_at` with
       `Date.now()` -> all 838 lines churned on every build. Now a sha256 over the sorted candidate
       set, folded into a 13-digit integer (same magnitude as a Date.now() value).
    3. `scripts/build_restaurant_directory.py` set `buildStamp = int(time.time() * 1000)` -> new value
       every build, shipped in `eatouts_manifest.js`. Now a sha256 over the canonically-serialised
       manifest inputs (sorted keys), folded into a 13-digit int. Field name and type (int) unchanged.
  Audit justification (STAGE A-PRE):
    - A0.1 `buildStamp` is a genuine READ for cache invalidation: js/eatouts-brand.js `logoRev()` ->
      `bustPath()` appends `?v=<buildStamp>` to `assets/logo/*` URLs. Decision (user-approved) was to
      keep the field and make it content-derived: the documented intent ("edited logo art is fetched
      with a new URL") still holds - it now busts iff content changes instead of on every no-op build.
    - A0.2 `business_links.sql` row order is NOT load-bearing: every statement is `INSERT OR IGNORE`
      keyed on unique `id`; no test parses the file (tests use in-memory stubs); no FK constraints.
    - Slug-collision check: the dataset has exactly ONE numeric-suffixed slug
      (`fairgroundholdingsptyltdtabotswanaconfer2`, supplier). Its collision partner is a restaurant,
      and all restaurants are pushed before suppliers, so sorting CANNOT reassign that suffix.
      Verified post-build: id set is identical (838 = 838), no slug reassignment.
  CONSCIOUS DATA-CONTENT CHANGE (user-approved): `business_links.sql` row timestamps change ONCE,
  from wall-clock to content-derived (currently 8655508347967). `INSERT OR IGNORE` means existing D1
  rows are untouched; fresh loads see the derived epoch. All future builds are stable.
  Determinism proof (A-FIX.4): two back-to-back `npm run build` runs produced byte-identical
  `business_links.sql` (1BB092BB...) and `eatouts_manifest.js` (12EDA7FB...).
